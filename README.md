# Closet App

For the Mobile Application Programming we are required to develop a mobile
application that include several requirements. We have decided to develop a mobile
commerce application that will provided an online shopping application service. The idea
behind the reason of making this project this project by because a lot of us use online
shopping service especially during lockdown and everyone is not advised to go out.
The title for this mobile commerce application is Closet Shop which is suitable for our
mobile commerce application that sell clothing.

## The Motivation and Goal of This Project.
Some of the motivations that makes us want to develop this mobile application for our
project is because the lack of comfort as a web-based e-commerce is not portable. Web-based
e-commerce is more suitable to be use using laptop rather than phone browser. This is because
the layout of the website may not fit to the phone screen and it would be challenging to shop
online using web-based e-commerce via phone browser. Therefore, developing this mobile
commerce application will provide a different experience for customer.
Furthermore, we are aware that web-based e-commerce has a longer load time and the
perform action are also much slower compare to mobile commerce application. The poor
traffic management sometimes leads to a problem where the website is failed to load. Mobile
application stores the date locally and making the data retrieval happens in the blink of eye.
Therefore, by developing this mobile commerce application we hope to increase the efficiency
of the services.
Web-based e-commerce also is not very reliable towards customer in term of keeping track
of expenses or parcel. Users need to login account every time they want to retrieve some new
and personal information about their shopping experience. Hence, developing mobile
commerce application can ensure easiness and more reliable for customer usage.
